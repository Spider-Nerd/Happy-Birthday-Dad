        <p>Happy Birthday dad. I know these last few years have been difficult and that I've put you through a lot.
            I never had the chance to say it but thank you. Thank you for always supporting me, thank you for always
            believing in me, and for always having faith in me. Your support through everything has been beyond compare.
            It has made a significant difference in me, and I will forever be grateful.</p>
        <p>Thank you dad, I love you, more than words can describe</p>
